        <h4>HTML</h4>
        <p>
          HTML: Hyper-Text Markup Language  is a method or a language to display the content of
           webpages. HTML gives us the ability to access data from 
           differnt places by using different devices.

        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p>
          CSS: Cascade style Sheet is used to style our html to have a 
          better view. a Webpage without a styling is not going to have 
          a friendly user interface; As a result, it will discourage
           users from using again.

        <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
        <p>
          We don't want the content of websites to be scattered all over the places
           within website due to different devices' size. We need to add 
           some features and some of the codes so the 
          website will respond accordingly based on the size of the media.
